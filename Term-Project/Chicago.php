It was very good Opponutiny for me to go USA without any payment like dorm fee since<br>
It was cost from Gachon Univ.. I used only 500 dollars per month. <br>
I chose United Airline via Tokyo Narita International.<img src="plane.png" width="25"/><br>
It was not the cheapest Airline but I want to experience the oversea flight<br>
because I wondered the difference from Korean Airline.(It was totally diffent..^^HaHa)<br>
Long flight made me boring and tiring but it was fun as well.<br>
In United Airline, There were no TV, remote control, sandle shoes.^^;;. Except for these, Soooo nice!!<img src="heart.png" width="17"/><img src="heart.png" width="17"/><br>

 <p>After coming to Purdue University, we got a Level test. All students have<br>
  the highest class(I don't know why^^;;)<br>
  We had Listening, Reading, Speaking, Writing Class.<br>
  It helped us learn English so Efficiently and fast.<br>
  We studied Mathematics in English as well, but it was not fun...lol^&^<br>
  We developed the swimming pool with mathematical knowledge, but Korean students<br>
  are very good at math, so it made us so boring.<br>
  We got a presentation, and many tests. In the class, we have lots of discussions<br>
  We've got to know much about the difference of culture from Korea<br>
  We thought about lot's of topics with English.<br>
  It was very short period but gave us big chance to study English so effectively.</p>

However, I didn't think that it was not such big scale!! Wow~!<br>
There were very lots of people and the seats were all bought.<br>
<br>
As the play started, all people in Purdue team supporters cheered<br>
"Let's Go Purdue !! Let's Go Purdue !!" They seemed like Union.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With them, I was excited with the play~! Above all, Our Purdue Univ. Team<br>

We went to a restaurant(I can't remember the name of restaurant^^;;)<br>
There are lots of people. It was rainy that day, and on the street, <br>
There are no people outside but there were many people in the restaurant!!<br>
I knew why there were lots of people after I ate their food<br>
I ordered the Waffle with Maple syrup. It was so high-quality and seem awesome.<br>
The taste was also perfect!! Beside this, other menus like steak, sandwich was <br>
Nice As well.<img src="heart.png" width="17"/><img src="heart.png" width="17"/><img src="heart.png" width="17"/><br><br>

There were lots of people!! and children!! . <br>
There were also many kinds of fishes, dolphins, the ocean plants and so on.<br>
Above all, There was great dolphin show. But we were dissapointed of it. because<br>
It was too bored. Dolphins are just jump around and then That's finish.<br>
We also watched the documentary, but it was bored either.....¤Ð¤Ð<br>
We thought that Korean Aquarium was better than there. There were just fishes and....that's all^^;;<br>
But the cost fee was almost 50 thousands won....;; So expensive<br>
However, it was also great experience for me.<br><br></p>

<p>After finishing the Shedd Aquarium, We went to Furious Ramen restaurant in Darren Station.<br>
We took bus and went go Chicago city, and took the subway and got off at the Darren Station.<br>
There atmosphere was so scared. There are less streetlight, people. <br>
There is the drawing on the wall. We discussed and determined that we would go back to Purdue Univ.<br>
after eating furious Ramen. We found the Furious Ramen. The air was so scared and dark.<br>
But there are so many people. My friends that that restaurant was so famous<br>
I ate furious Ramen. It was sooooo spicy. I heart that American people do not like eating spicy.<br>
But the Furious Ramen was changed my mind.
Lot's of American were enjoying eating spicy and furious ramen.<br>
But it was delicious. I like Japanese Ramen and their taste, smell. So it was very adequate for me!<br>
I want to eat now^^</p>

However, things got changed when we arrived at the castle(like Medieval Castle!!)<br>
The counter staff gave us the crown and said that..<br>
<b>"Congratulation! you are White Team!"</b><br>
What? White team? I didn't understand .. When we entered the roby,<br>
There are wine bar and people who wore the dress like Medieval people..<br>
So amazing and fun .. Wow What a special experience is this!!!!<br>
We accessed the stadium, and the fight was started. A waitress came and gave us the<br>
soup and potato and said "It is the Dragon blood and Dragon egg"<br>
What? It is so fun Haha They make me laughing, and I could eat the dinner happily so delicious.<br>
<br>
The Fight was amazing, there were 7 teams and one team has one warrior(like Gladiator in Medieval times).<br>
And fight each other. It was exciting but our team lost the game so quickly but it was so special.<br>
After the show, we can have the photo  time with the actors and Gladiators they are so cool<br>
and handsome, pretty, beautiful. It was so nice experience for me.<br>
