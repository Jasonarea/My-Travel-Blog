<div>
<p>I went to Japan after I finished military service last August. I used Japan Airline.<br>
At that time, I didn't know the tip that can buy cheap ticket.<br>
I thought that the people using Japan Airline was too short at that time.<br>
I become to know why!!! ^^ <br>
There are 3 Enterprises that include the airlines, Korean Airline is in Skyteam and <br>
Asiana Airline is in Star Aliance. But, Japan Airline is in One World.<br>
It is not related with the Korean/Asiana Airline, so people do not use the JAL in Korea.<br>
JAL was the nice interior and their service and attendant was so nice.<br>
I ate sushi for lunch in the flight..I used Japanese(When I learned at the high school,<br>
I helped me a lot..^^;;) "Give Me Mizu!!!!!"<br>
Finally, I arrived at the Tokyo Haneda International.<img src="plane.png" width="20"/> <br>
Tokyo has two airport. One is Tokyo Narita International which I used when I went to Chicago<br>
and Haneda that was smaller than Narita. I used Haneda, because<br>
Haneda was near the city. so I can go to Shinjuku which was in the hoter that I reserved!!<img src="heart.png" width="17"/><br>
I waited ^^ for 4days which was very short but long^^!!<img src="JayG.gif" width="100"/>

<p>I used the Monorail from Haneda to Hamamatsutsyo <br>in order to go to Shibuya.<br>
It was special experience for me. <br>I heart that in Korea, there is Monorail in Daegu<br>
But I didn't experience that. <br>So it was so exciting for me.<br><br>
The special thing that I think was that there were three kinds of trains (Express, Mid-express, All-stop).<br>
But it has just 5~6 minutes.<br>I don't know why this system exists.<br>

After eating lunch, I walked and walked and walked from Shibuya station to Toyoko Line.<br>
There was Monkey Cafe which was so big. I had a coffee time. <br>
The staff served the coffee for customer there, it was different from Korea wasn't it?<br>
Continuous walking and walking and walking , finally I got to Dayakanyama Station.<br>
There was a famous bookstore, when I went into there, there were lots of people<br>
who read books. There are restaurants and Starbucks. Also, they sold the Movie DVD and Music Album as well. So large and hot place.<br>
But I don't have money ばば I couldn't buy anything...ばば So sad...ばば<br>
After watching the bookstore, there were Icecream store(I don't remember the name;;;)!!<br>
It was sooooo expensive...One icecream was almost 5000 won...It's like thief!!!<br>
However, I was so hot and tired so I bought it!!! but it Was So delicious!!

<p><br>I took the subway and went to Rokbbonggi Station.(The name was weird;;)<br>
Rokbbonggi is so famous place. There were Mori Tower and Asahi TV<br>
In front of the Mori Tower, there were Doraemon!!!(CuutteEe)<br>
and there was an event that we have to save the water!! I want to participate in<br>
but I didn't (because I'm alone^^;;)<br>
Asahi TV was famous for Doraemon so there is a festival for Doraemon!!<br>
and they sell the Doraemon products for foreigners!!(I don't Have Money!!!!ばば)<br>
After that, I went to the restaurant to eat the dinner.<br>
I ate Japanese noodle called udon.</p>

 <p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Morning of August 20, I woke up at 8:00. I was very sleep then, but I got up early<br>
 because of the busy schedule. It was raining that day, but luckily I have umbrella haha^^<br>
 I went to Shimbashi station directly. I went to the Starbucks and ate bread and Americano<br>
 (short size ばば Finential Crisis...)<br>
 There are too many people who were going to company..it was similar to Korea (Busy Morning)<br>
 In the subway(Green line), there are too many people...like Korean Line 9 Express train...^^;;<br>
 Finally, I arrived at Shimbashi station and transferred to another Ocean subway called 'Yurikyamome'<br>
 It runs over the sea, so I took the subway and watched the window(ばば No picture )<br>
 But!!! OMG!!! I lost my umbrella OMG ... but it was raining a lot!!!!<br>
 At the Family mart(Convenience Store) I bought the new one...(I don't have money..)<br>
 <img src="Mooji3.gif" width="120"/>This Emoticon was similar to me .....UAAAAAAA...<br>
 There were Venus Fort, but it was closed. I thought that because it was morning, it was not opened yet.<br>
 and there are too many people in a row. I thought that there would be a bargain sale<br>
 It seemed that they did not sleep yesterday.<br>
 Next to the Venus Fort, there was a 'Tokyo Leisure Land'. When I went into there, <br>
 there are lots of game machine(but no people ^^ Haha). I watched and just walked and walked.....<br>
 walked around...and thought why I came to Japan without moneyばば OMG (Help me..)<br>
<br>
I just walked and walked around, the Aomi city, there was a festival.<br>
Japanese Girl Group singers were singing there and too many people were there<br>
